## Java Examples for Beginners
This repository contains a collection of Java code examples that are ideal for beginners who are just starting to learn Java programming.

## Prerequisites
To run these examples, you will need:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your local machine
- A Java IDE such as Eclipse, NetBeans, or IntelliJ IDEA

## Getting Started

1. Go to the see the [GitHub repository.](https://github.com/FaceND/Java)
2. Click on the green `"Code"` button and copy the URL to the repository.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to store the repository.
4. Run the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:  
```
git clone https://github.com/FaceND/Java.git
```

## Order of Java Examples

This is the  order in which to study the examples:

1. `SumScore.java`: A program that calculates the `sum` of two variables `score1` and `score2`.
2. `VatCalculate.java`: A program that calculates the total cost of a product including value-added tax (VAT).
3. `IfExample.java`: A program that demonstrates the use of the `if` statement to make `decisions` in Java.
4. `IfElseExample.java`: A program that demonstrates the use of the `if-else` statement to make `decisions` in Java.
5. `SwitchCaseExample.java`: A program that demonstrates the use of the `switch-case` statement to make `decisions` in Java.
6. `DoWhileExample.java`: A program that demonstrates the use of the `do-while loop` in Java.
7. `ForExample.java`: A program that demonstrates the use of the `for loop` in Java.
8. `ArrayExample1.java`: A program that demonstrates how to declare and manipulate arrays in Java.
9. `Products.java`: A simple program that prints `"Hello, World!"` to the console, which is a common first program for many beginning programmers.

Each of these programs is designed to illustrate a specific concept or technique in Java 
programming. By studying and running these examples, beginners can gain a better 
understanding of the fundamental concepts and syntax of the language.
